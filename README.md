Campsite_4_Me

Welcome to Campsite_4_Me! This project was created to help me learn the fundamentals of JavaScript, essentially putting the “fun” back into fundamental!

About the Course
This course has provided me with an understanding of several core concepts, including:

- Variables and Data Types: Understanding how to store, access, and manipulate data.
- Control Flow: Using conditional statements and loops to control the flow of programs.
- Functions: Beginning to understand how to write reusable code blocks.
- Objects and Arrays: Learning how to manipulate arrays and understand basic data structures.
- DOM Manipulation: Learning how to interact with and modify web pages.
- Asynchronous Programming: Getting introduced to promises, async/await, and handling asynchronous operations.
 
Goals
This course has equipped me with the knowledge to build dynamic web applications. I am excited to continue building this new skillset and apply it to future projects.
